### Dear Visitor, Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am Mahe, a senior year Computer Engineering student from India. </br> I code in Python and C++. </br> 
I recently completed an internship at [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge), via Outreachy, where I helped document the conda-forge ecosystem.</br> I am presently a Software Engineering Intern at [Quansight](https://www.quansight.com/) Labs where I am adding more package origins to [Grayskull](https://github.com/conda-incubator/grayskull#readme), which is a conda recipe generator for conda-forge.</br>
When I am not being lazy, I read books. I like to write too, mostly in fits of fervor, [here](https://renderingsofmyheart.wordpress.com/).</br> 
Out of deference for my graduation degree, I maintain a [technical blog](https://maheiram.medium.com/) as well.</br> 
I also happen to be a member of the University Dramatics Club and can do a Shakespeare or two.</br> 
To seem cool, I [tweet](https://twitter.com/IramMahe).
