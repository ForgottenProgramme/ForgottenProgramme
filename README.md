### Dear Visitor, Hello! 👋

I am Mahe, a senior year Computer Engineering student from India. </br> I code in Python and C++. </br> 
Presently I am a Software Engineer Intern at [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/). I previously worked at Quansight Labs and RedHat.</br>
When I am not being lazy, I read books. I like to write too, mostly in fits of fervor, [here](https://renderingsofmyheart.wordpress.com/).</br> 
Out of deference for my graduation degree, I maintain a [technical blog](https://maheiram.medium.com/) as well.</br> 
I also happen to be a member of the University Dramatics Club and can do a Shakespeare or two.</br> 
I [tweet](https://twitter.com/IramMahe). </br>
Oh, I have a [website](https://forgottenprogramme.github.io/) you might like to look at :).
