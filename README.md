### Dear Visitor, Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am Mahe, a new Berliner. <br>
I am a Software Engineer at [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).<br>
When I am not being lazy, I read books. I just finished reading "The Remains of the Day". If you've read this book or are currently reading it and would like to talk about it, please reach out to me. I love discussing literature and cinema! <br>
I like to write too, mostly in fits of fervor, [here](https://renderingsofmyheart.wordpress.com/).</br> 
I have a [twitter](https://twitter.com/IramMahe) account which I now use less and less. </br>
Oh, I have a [website](https://forgottenprogramme.github.io/) you might like to look at :).
