### Dear Visitor, Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I am Mahe, a senior year Computer Engineering student from India. </br> I code in Python and C++. </br> 
Sometime ago I was an intern at [conda-forge](https://github.com/conda-forge), via Outreachy, where I helped document the conda-forge ecosystem.</br> Recently I was a Software Engineering Intern at [Quansight](https://www.quansight.com/) Labs where I added more package origins to [Grayskull](https://github.com/conda-incubator/grayskull#readme), which is a conda recipe generator for conda-forge.</br>
I am presently a Software Engineer Intern at [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/).</br>
When I am not being lazy, I read books. I like to write too, mostly in fits of fervor, [here](https://renderingsofmyheart.wordpress.com/).</br> 
Out of deference for my graduation degree, I maintain a [technical blog](https://maheiram.medium.com/) as well.</br> 
I also happen to be a member of the University Dramatics Club and can do a Shakespeare or two.</br> 
I [tweet](https://twitter.com/IramMahe). </br>
The easiest way to reach me out is via Twitter DM. :)   </br>
Oh, I have a website you might want to look at: https://forgottenprogramme.github.io/ .
